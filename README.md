# Dino Party

A multiplayer dinosaur-collecting party game where guests scan QR codes to discover dinosaurs, tame them with food, customize their collection, compete in trivia, and team up to defeat a Godzilla boss fight — all in real time from their phones.

Built as a birthday party activity. Players move around the venue scanning printed QR codes to trigger encounters, collect items, and interact with the event.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.12+
- AWS CLI configured with credentials

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # Dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # Production build to dist/
npm test           # Run tests
```

### Backend (CDK)

```bash
cd infra
npm install
npx cdk bootstrap    # First time only (provisions CDK toolkit in your AWS account)
npx cdk deploy       # Deploy all resources
```

After deploying, set the stack output values as environment variables for the frontend:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=<RestApiUrl output>
VITE_WS_URL=<WebSocketUrl output>
VITE_PHOTO_BUCKET=<PhotoBucketName output>
```

### QR Codes

```bash
cd scripts
pip install qrcode pillow
python generate_qr_codes.py    # Outputs PNGs to scripts/output/
```

Print the generated QR codes and place them around the party venue. Each code maps to a specific dino encounter, food item, event station, or explorer's note.
